> My project is similar to this but little modification 

It will copy the text when we select the text and press numeric value
1. When we press 1 and select any word it will copy in clip1, and when we press 2 and select word then it will copy in clip2 and so on

2. For pasting when we press ctrl+1 then clip1 is pasted

3. when we press ctrl+2 then clip2 is pasted and so on


> Why I make this when it is already available in window

- This feature is available in window 10 and above 
- But my friend is using winow 7 so he want this feature so I Have created this

> Data structure used

- Array is used because it store the value and can easily retrive the data from array
